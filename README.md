**Input GST:** This refers to the GST a business pays when it  purchases goods or services used for its operations. It's essentially the tax on the inputs needed to run the business.

**Output GST:** This refers to the GST a business collects from its customers when it sells taxable goods or services. It's the tax levied on the output (sales) of the business.

*In simpler terms, imagine a business buying raw materials (input) with GST and then selling finished products (output) with GST.*


## Input Tax Credit (ITC):

1. Imagine you run a bakery (registered under GST).
2. You buy flour (an input) for ₹100 with ₹18 GST (assuming 18% GST rate). So the total cost is ₹118.
3. You bake delicious bread and sell it (output) for ₹200 with ₹36 GST (again, assuming 18% on the selling price).
4. Here's the interesting part: You can claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) of ₹18 (the GST you paid on the flour).

**Think of ITC like a coupon.**

5. Now, you subtract the ITC (coupon) of ₹18 from your total GST collected (₹36). So, your actual GST liability to the government becomes ₹36 (collected) - ₹18 (ITC) = ₹18.

This way, you only pay GST on the value you added (profit) in your business (₹200 selling price - ₹100 flour cost = ₹100 profit), not the entire transaction. This ensures a fairer tax system.

Essentially, ITC helps you avoid paying tax on tax. It makes the GST system more efficient and reduces the burden on businesses.

OR

```You simply consider the GST you paid when you bought raw materials or used any services for your business.

In the bakery example:

GST paid on flour (purchase) = ₹18
ITC = ₹18 (This is the amount you can claim as credit)
Then, to determine your final GST liability:

GST collected from selling bread (output) = ₹36
ITC claimed (from flour purchase) = ₹18
GST payable to government = ₹36 (collected) - ₹18 (ITC) = ₹18
So, you only pay GST on the value you added (profit) after claiming the ITC for the tax you already paid on purchases.
```
