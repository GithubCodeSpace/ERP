**Input GST:** This refers to the GST a business pays when it  purchases goods or services used for its operations. It's essentially the tax on the inputs needed to run the business.

**Output GST:** This refers to the GST a business collects from its customers when it sells taxable goods or services. It's the tax levied on the output (sales) of the business.

*In simpler terms, imagine a business buying raw materials (input) with GST and then selling finished products (output) with GST.*


## Input Tax Credit (ITC):

1. Imagine you run a bakery (registered under GST).
2. You buy flour (an input) for ₹100 with ₹18 GST (assuming 18% GST rate). So the total cost is ₹118.
3. You bake delicious bread and sell it (output) for ₹200 with ₹36 GST (again, assuming 18% on the selling price).
4. Here's the interesting part: You can claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) of ₹18 (the GST you paid on the flour).

**Think of ITC like a coupon.**

5. Now, you subtract the ITC (coupon) of ₹18 from your total GST collected (₹36). So, your actual GST liability to the government becomes ₹36 (collected) - ₹18 (ITC) = ₹18.

This way, you only pay GST on the value you added (profit) in your business (₹200 selling price - ₹100 flour cost = ₹100 profit), not the entire transaction. This ensures a fairer tax system.

Essentially, ITC helps you avoid paying tax on tax. It makes the GST system more efficient and reduces the burden on businesses.

OR

```You simply consider the GST you paid when you bought raw materials or used any services for your business.

In the bakery example:

GST paid on flour (purchase) = ₹18
ITC = ₹18 (This is the amount you can claim as credit)
Then, to determine your final GST liability:

GST collected from selling bread (output) = ₹36
ITC claimed (from flour purchase) = ₹18
GST payable to government = ₹36 (collected) - ₹18 (ITC) = ₹18
So, you only pay GST on the value you added (profit) after claiming the ITC for the tax you already paid on purchases.
```

**Turnover**: _Turnover in business, also referred to as gross revenue or sales, is the total amount of money a business generates from its core operations over a specific period. It essentially represents the income earned before any expenses are deducted._

### GST REGISTRATION

Turnover Threshold: Any business supplying taxable goods or services must register if its aggregate turnover in a financial year exceeds:
- ₹40 lakhs for regular states
- ₹10 lakhs for special category states (refer to [Notification No.10/2019](https://cbic-gst.gov.in/pdf/rod-10-2019-cgst-english.pdf) for a list)
- Inter-State Supply: Businesses involved in supplying goods across state borders, irrespective of their turnover.
- E-commerce: Businesses supplying goods through e-commerce platforms (even if below the turnover threshold).
- Successor of Registered Business: If a registered business is transferred or demerged, the new entity needs to register from the transfer date.
- Previously Registered Under Other Laws: Businesses previously registered under pre-GST laws like Excise, VAT, or Service Tax.

Optional GST Registration:

- Businesses with turnover below the threshold limit.
- Businesses making exempt supplies (e.g., agriculture, education, healthcare).
- Small businesses with turnover less than ₹20 lakhs can voluntarily register under GST.
- Businesses with turnover between ₹20 lakhs to ₹1 crore can opt for composition levy.
